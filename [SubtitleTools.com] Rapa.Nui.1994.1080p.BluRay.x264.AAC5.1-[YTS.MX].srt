1
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,199
Some 1,500 years ago,

2
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,284
a small band
of Polynesian voyagers

3
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:37,370
discovered one
of the most remote islands

4
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,621
on the face of the earth

5
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:41,749
and gave birth to a mystery
that still endures.

6
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:44,335
The voyagers and their chief,
Hotu Motu'a,

7
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,045
settled the lush little oasis

8
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,922
and were lost
to the rest of the world

9
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,174
for the next thousand years.

10
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,344
Then, on Easter Sunday 1722,

11
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,013
European sailors
rediscovered the island

12
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:58,516
and named it Easter Island.

13
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,060
The Europeans found a barren,
treeless place

14
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:05,064
inhabited by thousands of people
divided into warring clans

15
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,400
and the gigantic stone statues
they had built

16
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,279
over hundreds of years as a form
of ancestor worship.

17
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,031
The descendants of Hotu Motu'a
called their island

18
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:16,409
the navel of the world,
Rapa Nui,

19
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,495
and centuries of total isolation
had convinced them

20
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,456
they were the only people left
on Earth.

21
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,125
To this day, no one knows

22
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,335
exactly why the statues
were so large

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,005
or why the work on them
had suddenly ceased,

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,507
but island legend speaks
of a terrible conflict

25
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:33,092
between the clans

26
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:35,886
a few decades before
the Europeans arrived.

27
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:13,020
Noro! Noro!

28
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,781
Noro, the ariki-mau
wants to see you.

29
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,515
Well?

30
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,141
It's hard to say.

31
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,601
Tell me the truth.

32
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,228
I would if I could, my ariki,

33
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,814
but the signs are neither good
nor bad.

34
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,774
We should look again later,
perhaps.

35
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,236
I must know when, Tupa.

36
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,613
Try something else.
Try the smoke again.

37
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,323
I think we were doing something
with that.

38
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:07,992
Yes, Ariki.

39
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,787
Matua Tane.

40
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,300
Your cousin Epe
by my wife Auareipua

41
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:28,178
has fallen while training
for the birdman competition.

42
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,515
That's his body lying there
before the ah...

43
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,601
You must take his place.

44
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,810
Me?

45
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:39,481
That's what the signs command,
according to Tupa.

46
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,276
But... I'm not ready.

47
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,696
I know, but there's no one else.

48
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:49,033
They're all gone or dead,
except you.

49
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,160
So, Noroinia,

50
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:56,665
the priests of the Miru clan
invite you to compete for...

51
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,375
- for...
- The first egg.

52
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,377
...the first egg at Orongo

53
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:04,465
when Hotu Matu'a sends his birds
in the spring.

54
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,385
Will you swim for me...
the ariki-mau...

55
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,721
the reigning birdman?

56
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,890
Yes.

57
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,061
Tell the other Long Ears

58
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,688
they're wasting their time
selecting swimmers

59
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:21,357
because Noroinia will prevail,

60
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,026
making me birdman
for the 20th year.

61
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:29,448
It's finished, Ariki-Mau.

62
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,534
Will you give your approval?

63
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,468
Ah.

64
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:33,429
Build another one.

65
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,018
Take the rest
of the day off, Heke.

66
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:45,899
Ariki, please, may I ask,

67
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,986
how does this moai displease
the gods?

68
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:53,866
It's too small.

69
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,421
Take the ropes.
Take the ropes.

70
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,396
Bring it down.

71
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,671
Come on, Heke.
Get up.

72
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,886
Ramana!

73
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,891
Ramana!

74
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:26,810
Koreto, have you seen Ramana?

75
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:28,687
Look what I've brought her.

76
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,819
I think you know where she is.

77
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,712
Stop it, Noro.

78
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:56,632
I'm trying to tell you
something.

79
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,968
What is it?

80
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:02,512
- What is it?

81
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:06,016
When the morning star
is two hands above the horizon

82
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,310
in midsummer, that's due west.

83
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:11,521
And they could read
the currents far out at sea?

84
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,190
Yes.

85
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,359
They'd strip off,
jump into the water,

86
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,735
and feel it with their balls.

87
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,698
My father's descended
from the navigator

88
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:24,701
in Hotu Matu'a's canoe.

89
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:26,161
He should know.

90
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:29,539
How come no one else knows this?

91
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,460
It's not important to them
anymore.

92
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,254
All they think about
are the moai.

93
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:41,510
Marry me.

94
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:50,477
- They'll never allow it.
- Why not?

95
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,145
They won't allow it.

96
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,691
Grandfather has to give me
something if I swim for him.

97
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,943
Noro, I'm Short Ear.

98
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:00,737
I love you.

99
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:04,908
You do now, but in a year,
when people talk?

100
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,535
They already talk.

101
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,954
They say I just want to be
Long Ear.

102
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,082
They say I just want you
for this.

103
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,294
Is that true?

104
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,090
I want you for my wife.

105
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,596
Have you told Make?

106
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,515
Not yet.

107
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:46,158
Get up, Short Ear.

108
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:10,766
- You have six moons.

109
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,518
Priest, that's impossible.

110
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:16,688
The last moai took six moons,
and it wasn't half as big.

111
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:19,232
Stop work on all other moai.
Focus only on this one.

112
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,692
Yes, but even then I c--

113
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:23,820
Should I find
another master carver?

114
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:25,113
The ariki wants it finished

115
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:27,282
before the birdman competition
in the spring.

116
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:28,450
What for?

117
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:29,826
What was wrong with the
last one?

118
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,078
What are you trying to do,
kill us?

119
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,829
How can we move it?

120
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,666
Old man.

121
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,339
Old man.

122
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:04,903
What is this fish?

123
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:07,489
This fish is taboo.

124
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:10,659
It's the ariki-mau's fish,
isn't it, until the next moon?

125
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,369
No one's allowed to catch it
until then.

126
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,621
It's too rare.

127
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:17,833
These rules are made
for everyone's benefit.

128
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,419
Aren't they?

129
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,257
Aren't they?

130
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,051
It was in the net with the --
the other fish.

131
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:29,678
It -- it was drowned.

132
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,014
I was bringing it to the
ariki-mau, knowing it was his.

133
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,724
We'd never eat taboo fish,
Priest.

134
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,017
Why, surely it would kill us.

135
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,061
That's right. We know that!

136
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:42,357
You broke a taboo.

137
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,074
Six moons.

138
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,267
So, news from the quarry?
You gave them the plan?

139
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:18,935
Yes, Ariki.
They loved the idea.

140
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,270
Oh, wonderful.

141
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,898
Good man, that Heke.
Have him spare no effort.

142
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,233
They've got plenty of food
and... whatever out there.

143
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:27,611
- All taken care of.
- Good, good.

144
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,239
Oh, the clouds are quite fast
for this time of the year.

145
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:32,782
Odd.

146
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,660
Did I tell you?
I've lost three more teeth.

147
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,537
Do you think it means anything?

148
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,415
- Never know.
- I think it does. I really do.

149
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,294
He's this close
to sending for us, Tupa.

150
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:47,631
If we can just get
one of these right.

151
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,550
Matua Tane,
I need to ask you something.

152
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:51,718
Ask.

153
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:56,640
Uh, I was thinking, Matua Tane,
after the birdman competition...

154
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,850
- Mm-hmm?
- I thought...

155
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:00,393
I'd like to get married.

156
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,646
Ah! Of course.
Good.

157
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,772
Who's the girl?

158
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,899
She's a... Short Ear.

159
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:08,401
What?

160
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,737
She's Short Ear.

161
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,200
- Put me down!

162
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,044
Are you turning out
like your father?

163
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,128
- Huh?
- No. I just --

164
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,880
Are you trying to provoke
the gods, as he did?

165
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:30,423
- No. I --
- Here am I, giving you a chance

166
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,841
to make up for what he did,

167
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,469
and now you're acting
exactly like him!

168
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:36,012
I'm not like him, Matua Tane.

169
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:38,890
Then what is this talk?
A Short Ear!

170
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,060
You want me not to swim for you?

171
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,812
No.

172
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,857
The bones say it has to be you.

173
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,777
No one else can atone
for your father's sin.

174
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:53,780
That's why the white canoe
hasn't been sent.

175
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:57,701
After 19 springs, 19 winters...

176
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:02,956
what else could it possibly be
except the statues?

177
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,836
What's her name?

178
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,129
Ramana.

179
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,590
Haoa's daughter?

180
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,050
Haoa the canoe builder,
the one I banished?

181
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:15,135
Yes.

182
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,678
Oh.

183
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,808
Why do you have to marry
this girl?

184
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:24,185
Can't you just take her
and be done with it?

185
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,398
I love her, Matua Tane.

186
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,653
All right.

187
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:35,780
- Let me talk to the priest.
- No!

188
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,209
There is a way.

189
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,337
Tupa will explain.

190
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,632
This is most unusual and taboo,
as you well know,

191
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:58,136
but if you win,
the gods should be placated

192
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,305
if this woman has been purified
first.

193
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,640
Purified how?

194
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,516
By entering the Cave
of the White Virgins.

195
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,560
- Her skin is far too dark.
- For how long?

196
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:08,521
- Until the birdman race.
- That's six moons!

197
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,148
Yes, it is.

198
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:11,316
She could die in there.

199
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,567
Possibly.

200
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:16,321
Matua Tane,
I can't let her do that.

201
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,074
I can't risk angering
Hotu Matu'a,

202
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,243
not when we're this close.

203
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,496
How badly does she want to be
your wife?

204
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,001
Good!
Then it's settled.

205
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:32,462
Do you know what
I've been thinking, Tupa?

206
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:36,549
The ariki's grandson shouldn't
steal chickens, especially mine.

207
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,637
Don't the old stories say
that Hotu Matu'a wore a hat?

208
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,763
Hat?!

209
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:45,600
Yes. They must be red,
the royal color.

210
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,727
And we want them immediately.

211
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,171
Think you're too good
for us, huh?

212
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,222
Hey.
Hey.

213
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,439
Hello, Uka, Koreto, Hitirenga.

214
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:35,734
Traitor!

215
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,980
Well?

216
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,733
He said yes.

217
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,445
If I win...

218
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,990
and if you stay in
the Virgin Cave until the race.

219
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,620
I said no.

220
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:32,457
Ramana, it doesn't matter.

221
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,627
You and I can just go on
the way we have.

222
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,797
It doesn't matter if we live
Short Ear or Long Ear.

223
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,799
We'll just keep to ourselves.

224
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:41,925
I'll do it.

225
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:46,554
Ramana... it's completely dark
in the cave.

226
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,014
You can't stand up.
You can't move.

227
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:49,140
You --

228
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:51,893
I'll do it if you'll swim.

229
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:57,232
I don't want us to be forbidden
or secret anymore.

230
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:04,155
They don't think we love each
other enough to go through this.

231
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,953
But they're wrong...
about me.

232
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,767
Wait.

233
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:48,861
I'm sure her skin will grow
as pure as a baby's,

234
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,572
but I doubt
that her virginity will.

235
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,909
It'll be our little secret.

236
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,511
Finished for the day!

237
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:15,346
Stop work!

238
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,183
- What's this?
- The ration.

239
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:21,811
The ariki-mau promised
we could keep 30% of the crop

240
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:23,730
- from now on.
- That is 30%.

241
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,273
Well, why don't you grow
some more?

242
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,150
Why don't you quit having
so many brats?

243
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,903
I'll have as many as I please,
you long-eared --

244
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,031
Would you like to take it up
with Tupa?

245
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,198
Huh?

246
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,329
That's a good lad, Atta.

247
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,832
Anyone else?

248
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,626
- Don't tell me he wouldn't.
- Get over here.

249
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,336
- I've seen him do it.
- Hey, what's on your head?

250
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,047
- Let me see that.
- That Koreto,

251
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,674
she'll get us all in trouble
with Tupa and the gods.

252
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,051
She's broken so many tapus,

253
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,095
Makemake will surely
eat her soul when she dies.

254
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,347
At least he'll
have something to eat.

255
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,849
- Don't blaspheme.
- Hey!

256
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:02,477
- Hey! Hey!

257
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,855
Give it back!
That's right. Give it up.

258
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:16,491
You hungry?
Come on.

259
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,798
Wa-hoo!

260
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,140
Who'd you steal it from?

261
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:42,600
Tupa.

262
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,644
Again.

263
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:57,782
Go ahead.
I'm not that hungry.

264
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,878
You remember
when we were little?

265
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:12,171
You and me and Ramana

266
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,674
used to come up here
and climb this thing.

267
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,594
Back when there were more trees.

268
00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:20,346
Things change.

269
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:24,142
They say all this land
was covered with trees once.

270
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,646
I guess Hotu Matu'a will send
for us before they're all gone.

271
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:31,774
At least that's
what Grandfather says.

272
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:33,442
You really believe all that?

273
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,569
Don't you?

274
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:39,782
I only believe
in what I can see...

275
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:44,328
...and what I can feel...
and what I don't have.

276
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:49,167
What'd you bring me up here for?

277
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,336
Talk.

278
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:54,422
See who you think I'm gonna
have to beat in the race.

279
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,382
Ngaara and Kahumea.

280
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:57,842
What about Makita?

281
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,510
Can't swim.

282
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:01,095
You want to help me train?

283
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,682
Just some pointers, you know?

284
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:06,809
Thought you might like to,
for old times' sake.

285
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:08,436
Why?

286
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,647
So your grandfather
can be birdman another year

287
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:13,357
and work us all to death?

288
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,242
I have to win, Make.

289
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,039
They're gonna let us marry
if I win.

290
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,583
Where is she?

291
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,462
In the White Virgin Cave
until the race.

292
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,589
You let them put her
in that hole?

293
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,049
She wanted to!

294
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,759
It's the only way, otherwise,
the gods never --

295
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,302
The gods?!

296
00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:46,432
There are no gods...
except the ones we make up!

297
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:47,808
There's no spirit land!

298
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,478
There's no Hotu Matu'a
coming back for us.

299
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:54,065
There's nothing out there
but sea!

300
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,609
This is all there ever was!

301
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,569
It's all there ever will be,

302
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:02,073
no matter how many idiot statues
we build.

303
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:13,960
You love her, too.

304
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,463
That's it, isn't it?

305
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:23,344
You're as...
blind as your grandfather.

306
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:27,723
And even dumber
than your crazy father.

307
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,810
At least I know
who my father was.

308
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:40,653
I don't need
your Long Ear handouts anymore.

309
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,116
And we were never friends!

310
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,666
Will you swim for me,
the ariki-mau,

311
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:38,002
the reigning birdman?

312
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:49,680
Haoa!

313
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,932
Haoa!

314
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:08,866
Haoa, will you train me
to compete for the birdman?

315
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,702
My daughter sits in a cave
because of you.

316
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,748
They say you know the cliffs
and currents better than anyone.

317
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,666
- Do they?
- And you trained my father.

318
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,835
Crazy Long Ear.

319
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:23,964
- He won.
- Yes, he did.

320
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,426
And one day, he got in a canoe,
one of my canoes,

321
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:30,346
sailed over the horizon,
and never came back.

322
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,139
Got me banished to this place.

323
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,809
I'm not like him.

324
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,018
I can see that.

325
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:37,520
I'll give you what you want.

326
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,313
Will you?

327
00:31:39,438 --> 00:31:42,191
Then make the forest grow back
so I have wood to work.

328
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:44,860
And explain why Ramana's skin
is not good enough

329
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:46,695
for a Long Ear.

330
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,156
Will you train me?

331
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,369
No.
You're too ignorant.

332
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,928
Who's there?

333
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:13,764
- It's me.
- Noro?

334
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:15,891
No.
Make.

335
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:17,935
Oh.

336
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,146
How are you?

337
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,481
I'd love to stand up...

338
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:24,733
to move my legs.

339
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,235
Did they feed you today?

340
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,737
A little, yes.

341
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,031
I brought you something.

342
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,908
Here.

343
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,828
A sweet potato.

344
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:38,205
I'm sorry there's not more.

345
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,374
It's all I have.

346
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:43,711
I'm not rich...
and Long Ear, like him.

347
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,505
Make, you must stop this.

348
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,012
Ramana, you're Short Ear.

349
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,306
I'm Short Ear.

350
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,810
Why can't you love
your own kind?

351
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:02,521
You cannot choose
who you love, Make,

352
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:05,608
only whose love to accept.

353
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,946
I can wait.

354
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:12,531
I've waited all my life.

355
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,716
He was here again, wasn't he?

356
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:32,218
Yes.

357
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,930
Are you cold?

358
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,640
I brought you something warm.

359
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,142
No. I'm fine.

360
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:44,980
Ramana...

361
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,025
...you think I've been ignorant?

362
00:33:49,276 --> 00:33:52,780
I think you've just been a boy.

363
00:33:55,282 --> 00:33:57,868
Is it night or day, my love?

364
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,704
It's night.

365
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:03,082
Your 45th.

366
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:15,553
Who will climb the cliffs
at Orongo in the spring

367
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,639
and swim with the sharks
to Motu Nui

368
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:21,433
for the first manutara egg?

369
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,564
And if you win...
who will be your birdman?

370
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:31,569
Let each clan announce
their choice now.

371
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:36,699
Kahumea for Mokoi
of the Marama clan.

372
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:45,791
Pountatea for Ataranga
of the Haumoana clan.

373
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:53,549
Hinaioio for Teaue
of the Hamea clan.

374
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,721
Makita for Hira
of the Kotuu clan.

375
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:04,643
Ngaara for Tiko
of the Ngatimo clan.

376
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,024
Noroinia of the royal Miru clan

377
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,151
for the ariki-mau
of all you see.

378
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,005
Ariki-paka.

379
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:02,678
Matua Tane...
something's worrying me.

380
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,388
The training?

381
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,143
Too many mouths having
too many children.

382
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,812
Good land turning to dust.

383
00:37:11,937 --> 00:37:14,314
It's the moai, Matua Tane.

384
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,400
They're eating everything...

385
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,944
and no one's thinking
beyond that.

386
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:24,533
I said to myself if you,
the ariki-mau,

387
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:28,620
knew this was happening...
it would stop.

388
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:34,376
Anyhow, this is what I see.

389
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,629
You worry about the race.

390
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,904
All clear!

391
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,072
Rollers ready!

392
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,036
But I don't understand.
Replaced?

393
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,412
Effective immediately.

394
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:12,498
It's taken four and a half moons
to get this far.

395
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,291
You're well behind schedule,
Heke.

396
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:16,585
But we've had to do hats
as well, Priest,

397
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,754
and there's not enough rope.

398
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,589
Riro's in charge now.

399
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:23,509
But... this is not possible.

400
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,637
I've been master carver
for 27 years.

401
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,931
This is... all I have.

402
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,892
You're old, Heke.
Now join the crew.

403
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:33,143
Move it!

404
00:38:39,691 --> 00:38:41,443
Sorry, Heke.

405
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,706
Try and forget about it.

406
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,376
Go dump this.

407
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,132
Lines ready!

408
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,802
Ready!

409
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,974
Pit ready!

410
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,517
Ready!

411
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:17,563
Cut the keel.

412
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,064
Cut the keel!

413
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,304
Again.

414
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,680
Come on!

415
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:14,119
Hold. Hold.

416
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,793
Pull the rope!

417
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,421
Pull the rope!

418
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,722
More men!

419
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:36,475
Do as I say!
Quickly!

420
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,769
Move! Move!

421
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,354
Move!

422
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,985
Move! Move!

423
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,413
What for?

424
00:41:04,169 --> 00:41:06,838
Heke! Heke!

425
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,059
[ Rumbling, men shouting

426
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:21,561
Heke!

427
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:24,648
Heke!

428
00:42:38,972 --> 00:42:40,182
We want more.

429
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,601
- More what?
- More of everything.

430
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,686
There used to be plenty
for everyone.

431
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:45,771
Yes.

432
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,148
Well, that was before there were
so many of you, wasn't it?

433
00:42:48,273 --> 00:42:49,816
There's more Long Ears now, too.

434
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:51,443
But there's a lot more of you!

435
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:52,861
We like it that way.

436
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,323
It's good to have
lots of children.

437
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,659
It honors the ancestors.

438
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:03,163
Why aren't you in the quarry?

439
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,873
Heke's dead.

440
00:43:04,998 --> 00:43:06,541
I heard.

441
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,543
Terrible thing.
Terrible.

442
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:10,253
We were just discussing, Ariki,

443
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:12,380
how the Short Ears want more
of everything.

444
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,926
And it's been pointed out that
since there's more of everyone,

445
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:19,221
especially them,
there is, unfortunately, less.

446
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,306
And we want more of what's left.

447
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:23,100
- Or what?

448
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,768
Or we're not building
any more moai.

449
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,853
Including the big one.

450
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,276
But Tupa said you loved
the project.

451
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:34,569
Huh! Tupa.

452
00:43:34,694 --> 00:43:36,822
Apparently I was misled.

453
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,074
Not finish the moai?
Are you mad?

454
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,494
Have you lost your minds?
Everything depends on that.

455
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,079
Then we want half the crops,
Ariki.

456
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,997
- Half!

457
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,999
- Half the wood for fuel.
- What?

458
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,293
- And no more hats.
- That's ridiculous!

459
00:43:50,418 --> 00:43:52,504
So is your stupid statue.

460
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,423
And one more thing.

461
00:43:56,007 --> 00:43:57,008
What?

462
00:43:58,718 --> 00:44:00,720
We want to compete
for the birdman.

463
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,597
- Kill them!

464
00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:04,808
- Then who will build the moai?

465
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,186
None of us remember how.

466
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:17,195
A word, please, Tupa.

467
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,450
I don't need this, Priest.

468
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,786
I've got chicken entrails
to read.

469
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:27,622
Let me slay these troublemakers,
sire, and make your day serene.

470
00:44:27,747 --> 00:44:29,207
Just give them something,
Matua Tane --

471
00:44:29,332 --> 00:44:30,333
a little food and fuel.

472
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:31,501
They'll get what they want,
and so will you.

473
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:32,752
Short Ears competing
for the birdman.

474
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:33,753
This is unheard of.

475
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,422
You know I'll win, Matua Tane.

476
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,090
They're too tired from working
to climb and swim,

477
00:44:37,215 --> 00:44:39,217
but you've got to let them think
that they've got something!

478
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:40,427
Forgive me, Ariki-Paka,

479
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,263
but I don't recall your opinion
having been sought.

480
00:44:43,388 --> 00:44:45,932
Then recall me not caring,
Priest.

481
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,104
T-This is unheard of, Ariki.
It's bad precedent.

482
00:44:51,229 --> 00:44:53,690
Just give them something!

483
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,526
Why?

484
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,071
Because I see real danger
in all this.

485
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,162
Why has everything got to be
so difficult?

486
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,834
- Here he comes.

487
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:18,924
You... have broken
so many tapu today

488
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:23,386
that Makemake should eat your
souls in hell for all eternity!

489
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:29,100
But I will grant these requests
on one condition.

490
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:33,480
For the Short Ears to enter
the birdman race,

491
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:37,234
the great moai must be finished,
with a hat,

492
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,654
by the time the sunbirds arrive
at Motu Nui.

493
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:44,074
But if he loses the race...

494
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:48,870
...the Short Ear competitor
will be sacrificed

495
00:45:48,995 --> 00:45:51,665
to honor the reign
of the new birdman

496
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,418
because of your insolence today!

497
00:45:57,879 --> 00:45:59,005
Now...

498
00:46:00,298 --> 00:46:03,969
...who would swim
for the Short Ears?

499
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,143
I will.

500
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,230
Make?

501
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:18,233
And if you win,
who'll be your birdman?

502
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,234
Myself.

503
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,738
Fine.
Back to work now.

504
00:46:23,863 --> 00:46:27,158
I make one last condition,
Ariki-Mau.

505
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,535
What?

506
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,538
If the great moai is finished
in time

507
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:35,542
and if I swim for
and win the birdman,

508
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,545
then the girl in the Virgin Cave
is my bride.

509
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,841
That seems fair.

510
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,595
Agreed.

511
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,182
Remember, just finish
the moai in time.

512
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,437
I don't want to hear it.
You said you'd win.

513
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,148
- Make!

514
00:47:08,366 --> 00:47:10,660
Make! Make! Make!

515
00:47:10,785 --> 00:47:14,748
Make! Make! Make!
Make!

516
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,250
Make! Make! Make!

517
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:30,722
Hold.
There. There!

518
00:47:33,391 --> 00:47:35,810
Canoe builder!
Join us!

519
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,021
Your future son-in-law
invites you to train him

520
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,190
for the birdman.

521
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,275
- I can't.
- Why not?

522
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,408
I already promised someone else.

523
00:47:55,663 --> 00:47:58,083
- Come on!

524
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,636
Eat.
Sleep.

525
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,514
At first light, we begin.

526
00:48:19,687 --> 00:48:22,315
This is our chance.

527
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,777
We have maybe a moon
before the birds come.

528
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:28,738
You must help me do
the impossible.

529
00:48:28,863 --> 00:48:31,783
But if we work all day...

530
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,785
when will you train?

531
00:48:34,994 --> 00:48:36,538
Starting now.

532
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,901
One! Two!

533
00:49:07,026 --> 00:49:08,820
Three!

534
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,738
One! Two!

535
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,615
Three!

536
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,742
One! Two!

537
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,744
Three!

538
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,955
One! Two!

539
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,665
Three!

540
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:23,960
One! Two!

541
00:49:24,085 --> 00:49:26,296
- Three!
- Three!

542
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,840
One! Two...

543
00:49:46,774 --> 00:49:48,234
How bad do you want to win?

544
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:49,486
More than anything.

545
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,740
Enough to see him sacrificed?

546
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:54,782
I guess.

547
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,159
No more guessing!

548
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,203
If you win, Make dies.

549
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,621
Accept that.

550
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,289
Believe me, he has.

551
00:50:02,248 --> 00:50:03,458
Your future.

552
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:08,588
From now on, you wear it
whenever you climb or swim.

553
00:50:08,713 --> 00:50:11,549
It must never break,
no matter what happens.

554
00:50:11,674 --> 00:50:15,178
If it does, you lose.

555
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,264
Now get back in the water.

556
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,686
How come you changed your mind?

557
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,774
I saw something...

558
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,484
I think.

559
00:50:50,588 --> 00:50:51,798
Ready?

560
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,218
Let's go.

561
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,232
Ready?

562
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,154
One! Two!

563
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,531
Three!

564
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,950
- Pull!

565
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:21,786
One, two, three!

566
00:51:21,911 --> 00:51:23,371
- Pull!

567
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:25,748
One, two, three!
Pull!

568
00:51:30,503 --> 00:51:32,797
One, two, three!

569
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:34,841
- Pull!
- Come on.

570
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:38,595
Reach up!
Up on the left there! Above you!

571
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:53,192
Faster.
And stop crossing your feet.

572
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,697
Pull!

573
00:51:57,822 --> 00:51:58,740
Ready?!

574
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:07,957
Pull! Pull!

575
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,708
- No resting!

576
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,335
You plan to rest in the race?

577
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,796
And stop fighting the surge.
You'll never win.

578
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,507
When it's not pulling, you swim!

579
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:04,681
Good!
Now get back out there!

580
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:53,247
Make.
We're running out of logs.

581
00:54:53,372 --> 00:54:54,415
The weight breaks them,

582
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,834
and the friction grinds them
to dust.

583
00:54:56,959 --> 00:54:58,085
Then grease them.

584
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,296
With what?
We have nothing left.

585
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:11,599
Use these.

586
00:55:11,724 --> 00:55:13,935
Cut the ration.

587
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,062
Nothing else matters.

588
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,612
Pretty soon we'll have nothing
to eat but each other.

589
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,839
Cover the egg. Come on!

590
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:46,092
The egg! Protect it!
Cover it!

591
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,928
- That's it! Come on!

592
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,862
Wake up.

593
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,924
Jump! Jump! Jump!

594
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:22,355
They might just do it,
Ariki-Mau.

595
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,148
I've never seen them work
like this.

596
00:57:24,982 --> 00:57:25,983
Good.

597
00:57:26,692 --> 00:57:28,152
Yes, it is.

598
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:29,403
But it also means

599
00:57:29,528 --> 00:57:32,740
we might actually see
the Short Ear compete.

600
00:57:32,865 --> 00:57:34,784
This Make, he's quite driven.

601
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,410
They say he never sleeps.

602
00:57:36,535 --> 00:57:37,870
Noroinia will win.

603
00:57:37,995 --> 00:57:39,747
Of course.

604
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:42,750
But what if something happens
and he doesn't?

605
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:44,919
What if no Long Ear wins?

606
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,129
I shudder to think
what changes we'd face

607
00:57:47,254 --> 00:57:49,131
if a Short Ear became
the birdman.

608
00:57:49,256 --> 00:57:51,300
Noroinia not win?

609
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:54,220
Why, that's like saying
that these great moai

610
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,305
are nothing but big rocks.

611
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,601
What are they fighting over now?

612
00:58:00,726 --> 00:58:02,520
Food, I imagine.

613
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,063
I don't want to hear
any more of this.

614
00:58:04,188 --> 00:58:07,775
We must speak of your grandson,
Ariki-Mau.

615
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,529
I think you place
too much confidence in him.

616
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,030
Noroinia?

617
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:16,242
Win or lose, he is
the next Miru chief, but...

618
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,077
Forgive me, sire --

619
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:21,706
your grandson is not cut
from the same stone as yourself.

620
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:25,543
He needs a strong hand --
someone trusted, like myself,

621
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,421
to guide his careless ways
in strange times like these,

622
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:32,675
or... even to replace him
should he suffer, say, some...

623
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,969
untimely, tragic death.

624
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,346
Death?

625
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:39,181
Tell me that I won't be

626
00:58:39,306 --> 00:58:41,726
just another skull
under the ahu, Tupa.

627
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:45,438
Tell me that you won't be making
fishhooks from my thighbones.

628
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,149
The white canoe.

629
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,652
That's my destiny... isn't it?

630
00:58:51,777 --> 00:58:53,571
Well, the signs
are certainly there.

631
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,531
See?!
Signs everywhere.

632
00:58:55,656 --> 00:58:57,283
You said so yourself.

633
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,994
That ring around the last moon.

634
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:03,164
That -- That strange taste
in my mouth.

635
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:06,834
And now --
I haven't told anyone this --

636
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:11,172
but each time I pee...
there is blood.

637
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,841
What could it possibly mean?

638
00:59:16,093 --> 00:59:18,387
Wondrous things, Ariki-Mau.

639
00:59:18,512 --> 00:59:20,931
Coming soon.
I'm sure.

640
01:00:17,696 --> 01:00:19,698
Don't worry, Long Ear boy.

641
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,201
We've only come for the tree.

642
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:26,205
Are you crazy?

643
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,415
This is the last one!
There's no more after this!

644
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,668
Someone's got to cut it down.
Why shouldn't it be us?

645
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,253
Just leave it!
It's just one!

646
01:00:34,755 --> 01:00:36,674
- Get him off.
- No!

647
01:00:39,176 --> 01:00:41,595
No!

648
01:00:43,013 --> 01:00:45,349
No!

649
01:00:45,432 --> 01:00:47,726
No!

650
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,714
Haoa...

651
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,341
why did my father leave?

652
01:01:20,926 --> 01:01:22,803
Was he as crazy
as everyone says?

653
01:01:25,222 --> 01:01:28,642
You've seen
where the craziness is.

654
01:01:28,767 --> 01:01:30,477
But where was he sailing?

655
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,605
There's no place to go.

656
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,648
All the lands have sunk.

657
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:37,735
He had to see for himself.

658
01:01:39,653 --> 01:01:40,988
Even if it killed him?

659
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,908
Your father was restless.

660
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,163
And when your mother died
having you...

661
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:52,124
everything here
stopped making sense to him.

662
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,753
Then one day...

663
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,798
...in a tide pool...

664
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,303
...he found this.

665
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,520
Is it made by the gods?

666
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,397
Or some sort of men.

667
01:02:20,819 --> 01:02:22,780
It has to be
from the sunken lands.

668
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:23,906
Doesn't it?

669
01:02:26,992 --> 01:02:28,619
Doesn't it?

670
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,927
Ramana, I'm here.

671
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:49,056
Ramana?

672
01:02:49,181 --> 01:02:50,557
- Ramana?

673
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,893
Noro?

674
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:55,271
Let me sleep, love.

675
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:57,564
Don't make me wake to this.

676
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,733
You have to eat.

677
01:02:59,858 --> 01:03:01,360
Here.

678
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:08,993
I was dreaming you'd won
when you woke me.

679
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,119
Yeah?

680
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,413
And of you and I
walking in the sun,

681
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:17,084
walking and just lying together
under our tree.

682
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,298
How wonderful.

683
01:04:19,396 --> 01:04:21,148
Where do you come from?

684
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,609
Where do you go?

685
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,618
Finished?

686
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,622
Yes.

687
01:05:23,877 --> 01:05:26,505
Where is it?

688
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:29,007
The white canoe.

689
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:41,562
Not enough, I guess.

690
01:05:45,065 --> 01:05:47,109
But you may compete.

691
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:10,924
Wear this for luck.

692
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:12,885
It was your father's.

693
01:06:20,225 --> 01:06:23,312
Were you friends...
you and my father?

694
01:06:25,355 --> 01:06:26,565
Brothers, really.

695
01:06:28,692 --> 01:06:30,444
Then why did you not go
with him?

696
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,703
I was afraid.

697
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:43,327
Good. Good.

698
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,911
More babies.

699
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:46,913
More everything.

700
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,749
That's what we need.

701
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,500
Isn't it?

702
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:37,130
Competitors, prepare yourselves

703
01:09:37,255 --> 01:09:40,801
to descend these heights...

704
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,803
to swim to Motu Nui...

705
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:45,555
and to find
the first manutara egg,

706
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:50,435
then to swim that egg back,
to carry it up the cliffs,

707
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,312
and present it, unbroken,

708
01:09:52,437 --> 01:09:55,649
into your birdman candidate's
hand.

709
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:59,152
That is what you must do to win,

710
01:09:59,277 --> 01:10:03,073
to be God's representative
on this navel of the world,

711
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:06,702
to hold sway
over all other clans.

712
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:12,624
And for two of you...
there's also this.

713
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,466
Matua Tane...

714
01:11:03,049 --> 01:11:05,427
...if I win, you retire.

715
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:09,014
It's time for a new ariki-mau.

716
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,077
Say go.

717
01:11:31,828 --> 01:11:32,913
Go!

718
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,244
Yeah!

719
01:12:44,484 --> 01:12:47,070
Aah!

720
01:14:08,985 --> 01:14:10,654
Aah!

721
01:14:40,016 --> 01:14:41,434
Aah!

722
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:26,206
The Short Ear, Make.

723
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:28,041
He's swimming strong.

724
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,793
What was it we promised him?

725
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,961
The girl in the cave.

726
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:07,140
Shave your head, Ataranga!
I have the egg!

727
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,773
Aah!

728
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:06,532
Aah!

729
01:20:13,641 --> 01:20:15,893
Aah!

730
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:58,686
Shark.

731
01:20:58,811 --> 01:21:01,606
Shark!
Shark!

732
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:24,504
Come on.

733
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:10,258
Three left --
red, yellow, black!

734
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:12,093
This should be interesting.

735
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:12,153
And what happens if the...
Short Ear loses?

736
01:23:12,778 --> 01:23:14,113
He dies!

737
01:23:47,813 --> 01:23:49,649
Help me!
Help me!

738
01:23:49,774 --> 01:23:51,484
Hit him!
Help me!

739
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:53,402
- Hit him!

740
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,154
- Hit him!

741
01:24:17,134 --> 01:24:19,971
Make! Make! Make!

742
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,940
Make! Make! Make!

743
01:24:31,023 --> 01:24:34,402
Make! Make! Make!

744
01:24:57,341 --> 01:25:00,678
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

745
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,518
Yeah!
Make!

746
01:25:07,643 --> 01:25:11,272
Make! Make! Make!

747
01:25:11,397 --> 01:25:13,733
Make! Make!

748
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:54,899
Noro! Noro! Noro!

749
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:59,111
Noro! Noro!
Noro! Noro!

750
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:03,366
Noro! Noro!
Noro! Noro!

751
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:07,370
Noro! Noro!
Noro! Noro!

752
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:33,729
I won.

753
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,692
Noro.

754
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,861
- Noro.
- Yes.

755
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:07,388
The white canoe.

756
01:27:07,513 --> 01:27:08,681
The white canoe!

757
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:19,817
Aah! Aah! Aah!

758
01:27:19,942 --> 01:27:21,736
The white canoe!

759
01:28:33,557 --> 01:28:35,309
Oh!

760
01:28:35,434 --> 01:28:36,352
Aah!

761
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:41,148
Ooh!

762
01:28:41,273 --> 01:28:43,984
Oh. Oh.

763
01:28:52,326 --> 01:28:53,744
Ah.

764
01:28:53,869 --> 01:28:57,122
Get hold of his arms.

765
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:05,047
Aren't you coming?

766
01:29:05,172 --> 01:29:08,217
Ramana is sick, Matua Tane.

767
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:11,178
I can't leave her.

768
01:29:11,303 --> 01:29:12,555
Priest!

769
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:17,560
All my life, Ariki-Mau,
I've waited for just this day.

770
01:29:18,227 --> 01:29:21,981
But someone must guide
the new ariki-mau...

771
01:29:23,065 --> 01:29:24,984
...until you send for us.

772
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:27,653
What did you think salvation
would look like?

773
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:30,155
Bye!

774
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:37,371
Farewell!
Remember me!

775
01:29:37,496 --> 01:29:39,456
Bye!

776
01:29:41,792 --> 01:29:43,294
Had to be the hats.

777
01:29:45,337 --> 01:29:46,630
Farewell!

778
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:50,676
Bye!

779
01:30:06,984 --> 01:30:10,779
You didn't tell me Make
was swimming, too...

780
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,823
and that he is to die.

781
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:17,036
You didn't tell me
about the child.

782
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,048
He was right.

783
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:31,884
The ariki-mau,
he knew the gods' will.

784
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:33,093
But now what?

785
01:30:33,218 --> 01:30:35,429
Does this mean Makemake
is about to descend on us?

786
01:30:35,554 --> 01:30:38,599
Really, I'm sure I saw the moai
on the Hamea ah...

787
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:39,642
They were breathing!

788
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:41,477
- Another Long Ear trick.
- Stop it!

789
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:42,645
There!

790
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:44,146
There!

791
01:30:46,523 --> 01:30:49,109
W-What are you doing here?

792
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:54,114
He lost.
I've come for his head.

793
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,244
And to tell you about the new
moai we're starting tomorrow.

794
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:03,540
New moai?
We're through with all that.

795
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:11,423
We're just getting started.

796
01:31:13,717 --> 01:31:15,761
You saw what happened today.

797
01:31:15,886 --> 01:31:18,055
The gods kept their promise.

798
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:22,726
The Long Ear mana proved
its power.

799
01:31:24,937 --> 01:31:25,938
So...

800
01:31:29,274 --> 01:31:32,945
...we're gonna build
bigger and bigger moai...

801
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:35,864
until the gods favor us again.

802
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:38,409
But with one little difference.

803
01:31:38,534 --> 01:31:42,621
From now on...
all moai will have...

804
01:31:44,206 --> 01:31:45,374
...beards.

805
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:04,476
Are you with me?

806
01:32:05,769 --> 01:32:08,897
He's a priest.
They are -- They are Long Ears.

807
01:32:21,827 --> 01:32:23,328
Not anymore.

808
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:37,718
What?

809
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:43,599
What?

810
01:32:44,558 --> 01:32:45,851
Noro, what was that?

811
01:32:45,976 --> 01:32:47,478
Something in the village.

812
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:49,271
- Fighting?
- I'll go see.

813
01:32:49,855 --> 01:32:50,731
Don't.

814
01:32:50,856 --> 01:32:52,399
I have to.
I'm the ariki-mau.

815
01:32:52,524 --> 01:32:53,525
Take me with you.

816
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:55,069
Ramana, you can't see.

817
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:57,071
I'll come back for you
as fast as I can.

818
01:32:58,489 --> 01:32:59,782
I'll be back.

819
01:33:57,881 --> 01:34:00,259
- No!

820
01:34:00,384 --> 01:34:01,760
Not yet.

821
01:34:13,021 --> 01:34:15,941
Come on, little boy!

822
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,700
Watch your people die,
Ariki-Paka.

823
01:34:24,825 --> 01:34:27,161
- Watch them.
- Don't turn away, Ariki.

824
01:34:27,286 --> 01:34:30,289
- Watch them burn.

825
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:34,168
Watch them.

826
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:37,629
Kill him, Riro.

827
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:39,298
Kill him.

828
01:34:41,758 --> 01:34:43,510
Riro!

829
01:34:57,191 --> 01:35:00,527
You've become
what you sought to destroy.

830
01:35:04,948 --> 01:35:06,950
We were friends once.

831
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:11,246
So I'll let you live.

832
01:35:14,374 --> 01:35:15,834
But we rule now!

833
01:35:52,204 --> 01:35:54,206
Move it!

834
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:00,379
Get him!

835
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:12,307
Suffer, Ariki-Paka!

836
01:36:45,549 --> 01:36:47,134
Ramana.

837
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:49,469
Ramana.

838
01:36:54,433 --> 01:36:56,518
Ramana!

839
01:37:01,606 --> 01:37:03,900
- Ramana!

840
01:37:04,026 --> 01:37:06,069
Ramana!

841
01:37:06,194 --> 01:37:07,738
Have you seen Ramana?

842
01:37:07,863 --> 01:37:09,406
Ramana!

843
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:12,159
Ramana!

844
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,665
Ramana!

845
01:37:20,584 --> 01:37:23,962
Atta, have you seen Ramana?

846
01:37:24,087 --> 01:37:26,131
I've been looking every --

847
01:37:29,926 --> 01:37:31,470
What are you doing?

848
01:37:31,595 --> 01:37:33,180
Filling our bellies.

849
01:37:34,723 --> 01:37:36,767
You can't do this.

850
01:37:37,893 --> 01:37:39,186
It's not who we are.

851
01:37:43,273 --> 01:37:44,900
Who's gonna stop us?

852
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:12,552
Haoa!

853
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:17,099
Haoa!

854
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:29,319
Your daughter.

855
01:38:56,513 --> 01:38:58,515
I thought I lost you.

856
01:39:02,018 --> 01:39:03,812
I thought
that's what you wanted.

857
01:39:03,937 --> 01:39:05,105
No.

858
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:07,023
We were both wrong.

859
01:39:17,033 --> 01:39:19,202
I know why my father left, Haoa.

860
01:39:19,786 --> 01:39:22,330
I understand now.

861
01:39:23,415 --> 01:39:25,750
Then you're ready for this.

862
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,306
Your wedding gift.

863
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,128
Come with us.

864
01:40:11,254 --> 01:40:12,714
No.

865
01:40:12,839 --> 01:40:16,176
If I'd have been braver,
I'd have gone with your father.

866
01:40:17,093 --> 01:40:19,471
Now I'm too old to go with you.

867
01:40:23,475 --> 01:40:24,476
Hurry.

868
01:40:59,803 --> 01:41:01,221
Don't look back.
